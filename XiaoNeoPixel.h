/*
 * NeoPixel driver for Xiao RP2040 module.
 * 
 * The Xiao module uses GPIO11 to supply the Neopixel (WS2812) with power.
 * GPIO12 is connected to its DIN signal.
 * 
 * Normally Neopixels are controlled using PIO, However there are rare cases where 
 * projects require the full PIO program memories for other purposes.
 * 
 * This project uses UART0 TX to write to the Neopixel, giving you another option :-)
 * This is not the most efficient method to update the WS2812, but it is mostly hw
 * driven and ressource friendly.
 * 
 * It uses the UART0 in 6 Bit mode with a matching baudrate and inverts the UART0 TX 
 * signal to make the trick :-)
